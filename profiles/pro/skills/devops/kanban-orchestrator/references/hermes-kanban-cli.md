# Hermes Kanban

The Hermes kanban is a durable SQLite-backed task board, shared across Hermes profiles, driven by the `hermes kanban` CLI. Cards can be executed autonomously by worker agents OR parked as human-action items.

## Three tracking systems — don't confuse them

When the user says "kanban", they mean THIS (the Hermes board). But two other trackers commonly coexist on the same machine:

- **Hermes kanban** (`hermes kanban`, `~/.hermes/kanban.db`) — agent task-execution board. The dispatcher can spawn worker agents to *do* cards. THIS skill.
- **`bd` / beads** (`~/darwin` and other repos) — git-tracked project issue tracker (Dolt-backed). See `beads-setup`. Topically scoped to a repo; don't put personal/email items here.
- **`triage` skill** — a state-machine workflow for triaging *issues* on an issue tracker (labels/roles). Unrelated to the Hermes board.

If the user says "kanban" plainly, default to the Hermes board. If they're inside a repo and mean issue tracking, ask or use `bd`.

## Key fact: tables are `tasks`, not `cards`

The schema uses a `tasks` table (plus `task_comments`, `task_links`, `task_events`, `task_runs`, `task_attachments`, `kanban_notify_subs`). There is NO `cards` table — querying `SELECT ... FROM cards` errors with "no such table: cards". Prefer the CLI over raw SQL.

## CLI quick reference

```bash
hermes kanban boards                       # list boards, show current
hermes kanban boards create <slug> --name "Display Name"   # new board
hermes kanban boards switch <slug>         # set current board
hermes kanban --board <slug> create "Title" --body "..." [flags]  # add a card to a specific board
hermes kanban --board <slug> list          # list cards on a board
hermes kanban --board <slug> show <id>     # full card + comments + events
hermes kanban --board <slug> comment <id> "note"
hermes kanban --board <slug> complete <id> # mark done
hermes kanban --board <slug> block <id>    # mark blocked
hermes kanban --board <slug> unblock <id>  # blocked/scheduled -> ready
hermes kanban --board <slug> archive <id>
```

Always pass `--board <slug>` explicitly when not on the current board — it's cleaner than relying on `switch`.

## Creating cards — the flags that matter

```bash
hermes kanban --board <slug> create "Title" \
  --body "Full description with context/source" \
  --priority <int> \            # tiebreaker, higher = sooner
  --created-by "Cooper Maruyama" \
  --json                         # emit JSON (returns the task id, e.g. t_4aabd479)
```

Other useful flags: `--assignee <profile>` (who executes it), `--triage` (park in triage; a specifier fleshes out the spec then promotes to todo), `--skill <name>` (force-load a skill into the worker, repeatable), `--max-runtime 30m`, `--goal` + `--goal-max-turns N` (run worker in a judged goal loop), `--idempotency-key <key>` (dedup — returns the existing id instead of duplicating).

Task ids look like `t_<hex>` (e.g. `t_4aabd479`).

## Human-action items vs agent-executable cards — CRITICAL

The Hermes kanban dispatcher can auto-spawn worker agents to EXECUTE cards. When the cards are really TODO / triage / review items meant for a HUMAN (deadlines, replies, decisions, "verify X was intentional"), you do NOT want a worker blindly running them.

Safe parking, in order of reliability:
1. **Leave `--assignee` unset.** Unassigned cards do not auto-dispatch — the dispatcher needs an assignee profile (and a running daemon) to pick a card up. This alone keeps human-action cards inert.
2. Use a dedicated board (e.g. `email-triage`) so they don't mix with executable work.

PITFALL — `--initial-status blocked` does NOT stick for unassigned cards: passing `--initial-status blocked` on `create` is intended for the running->blocked R3-gate transition; freshly-created unassigned cards still land in `ready`. That's fine because unassigned `ready` cards don't dispatch anyway. If you truly need them blocked, run `hermes kanban --board <slug> block <id>` after creation. Don't assume `--initial-status blocked` produced a blocked card — verify with `list`.

## Workflow: dumping a list of action items onto a board

1. `hermes kanban boards create <slug> --name "..."` (e.g. `email-triage`).
2. Script the card creation with the CLI (one `create` per item) — loop in execute_code, shlex-quote titles/bodies, capture the returned `t_...` id from `--json`.
3. Put real context in `--body`: source, date, deadline, sender — so the card is self-contained.
4. Set `--priority` higher for deadline/urgent items.
5. Leave `--assignee` unset for human-action items.
6. Verify with `hermes kanban --board <slug> list` and report the ids grouped by urgency.

Reusable helper: `scripts/bulk_create_cards.py` — edit `BOARD` + `CARDS` (list of `(title, body, priority)`), run it, and it creates each card (assignee left unset) and prints the `t_<hex>` ids. Works inside execute_code via `hermes_tools.terminal` or standalone via subprocess.

## The `triage` column — landing cards there

`triage` is a valid status (full set: `archived, blocked, done, ready, review, running, scheduled, todo, triage`). When the user says "add these to kanban **triage**" / "move them to the triage column", they want status=`triage`, not just any board.

- **At creation:** `create ... --triage` produces a card with status `triage` directly. Confirmed empirically (`SELECT id,status FROM tasks WHERE title=...` → `triage`). This is the clean path — prefer it.
- **Moving EXISTING cards into triage:** there is NO `hermes kanban` subcommand that moves a card *into* triage. `block`/`unblock`/`promote`/`schedule`/`complete`/`archive` exist, but none target `triage`. `specify --all` and `decompose --all` *sweep* the triage column (they consume it), they don't populate it. So to move already-created `ready` cards into triage, fall back to a direct DB UPDATE on the per-board DB, with a matching `task_events` audit row so the board stays consistent:

```bash
DB=~/.hermes/kanban/boards/<slug>/kanban.db
NOW=$(date +%s)
sqlite3 "$DB" <<SQL
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO task_events (task_id, kind, payload, created_at)
  SELECT id, 'status_changed', '{"from":"ready","to":"triage","by":"<name>"}', $NOW
  FROM tasks WHERE status='ready';
UPDATE tasks SET status='triage' WHERE status='ready';
COMMIT;
SQL
hermes kanban --board <slug> list --status triage   # verify via CLI
```

Lesson: if you know up front the cards belong in triage, create them with `--triage` and skip the DB step entirely. The DB UPDATE is only the recovery path when cards already exist in another status. Triage cards render with a `?` marker in `list` output — that's normal, not an error.

- **Filter a column:** `hermes kanban --board <slug> list --status <state>` (e.g. `--status triage`).

## Pitfalls

- **No `cards` table** — schema uses `tasks`. Raw SQL against `cards` fails. Use the CLI.
- **`--triage` for the triage column; no CLI move-to-triage** — to relocate existing cards into triage, UPDATE the DB + insert a `task_events` row (see above). Prefer creating with `--triage`.
- **Per-board DBs** — the default board lives in `~/.hermes/kanban.db`; named boards live at `~/.hermes/kanban/boards/<slug>/kanban.db`. `boards create` prints the path.
- **`--initial-status blocked` ≠ blocked for unassigned cards** (see above). Verify; `block <id>` after creation if needed.
- **Don't auto-assign human TODOs** — leaving `--assignee` unset is what keeps them from being executed by a worker agent.
- **`hermes kanban create` requires a current board or `--board`** — set/confirm the board first.
